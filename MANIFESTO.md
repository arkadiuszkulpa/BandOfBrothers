# 72Others Manifesto

*Where men are sent in pairs.*

## The Problem

You've done Exodus 90. Maybe twice. Maybe five times. And each time, when the 90 days end, you drift back. Back to the habits you swore to break. Back to the man you promised you'd never be again.

Here's the hard truth: **you don't need a programme to change your life.** If you had the self-discipline, you'd just do it. You wouldn't need 90 days of structure or a checklist or an app tracking your cold showers.

But you don't. Neither do I. We've failed for 10 years, 15 years, and we're terrified we'll keep failing until we wake up old men with lives not lived.

So we turn to programmes. And programmes fail us. Not because they're bad—but because they miss the one thing that actually works.

## The Design

God wants us to live life to the fullest. Not the bearded man in the sky telling you what to do—but the Creator. The Designer of this reality. The one who wrote the instruction manual.

Imagine getting a remote-control car for Christmas and instead of reading how it works, you dress it in doll clothes and wheel it around in a pram. That's absurd. Yet that's exactly what we do with our lives. We throw the instructions to the wind and try to redesign ourselves from scratch.

There is a design for men. How to live as a competent man. A man others rally to. A man who changes the world for the better.

The modern world has taken that from us. But most importantly, it has taken away **other men.**

## The Loneliness

We no longer know how to have real relationships with men. Our fathers didn't teach us. Society didn't show us.

At best, we know how to:
- Spend nights at a bar talking about football
- Sit in front of multiplayer games fighting virtual battles that lead nowhere
- Climb corporate ladders surrounded by "friends" who'd forget our names in a quarter

In all of this, we are still alone.

That friend you share a pint with every other night? He doesn't truly know you. You've never opened your heart to him. And even your wife—even if she's your closest friend in the world—will never fully understand a man's reality.

**We cannot do this alone.**

## The Squad

You do not go to war alone.

Even the largest army must be divided down to individual squads who know and trust each other. And within those squads, you have your battle buddy. The one who has your back when everything goes wrong.

You don't charge into fire because a general told you to. You do it because **you're in this together.** At some point, the result becomes irrelevant. Death? No problem. You lay down your life for something greater. For a cause—but a cause you fight for with your closest brothers beside you.

This is the structure that works:
- **Community** — The army. All of us, connected.
- **Fraternities** — The squad. 4-8 brothers who know and trust each other.
- **Anchors** — The battle buddy. Your pair. The one who won't let you fall.

## The Mission

This is why we're called **72Others.**

In Luke 10, Jesus sent not the Apostles, but 72 other disciples into the world. And He sent them **in pairs.**

Not alone. Never alone.

Whatever path you come from—Christian, atheist, agnostic. Whatever stage of life you're at. Whatever structure you want to use—Exodus 90, 75 Hard, or something else entirely.

**Don't do it alone.**

You need someone else on the same journey. Period.

## The Premise

This is not another complicated scheme. Not a paid membership programme that offers little in return.

This community is **free.** And it's **yours.**

The premise is simple:

1. **Join** the WhatsApp community
2. **Pick** a programme you want to do
3. **Find** an existing fraternity to join—or create your own and recruit brothers from the community

Form groups of 4-8 men. Pair up into anchors for daily support.

That's it.

---

## The Commitment

The defining characteristic of men in this community is simple: **they seek change.**

They are not satisfied with the status quo. They want more and they're hungry to find it. They are sinners. They are faulty. Just like everyone else.

But they will not give up.

**Will you?**

*72Others — Find your anchor. Choose your mission. Go together.*
